theme: Number Guessing Game
Idea: Create a game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The program gives feedback after each guess.
Steps:
1. Generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1-100).
2. User Inputs: Allow the user to enter guesses.
3. Decision Making: Compare the user's guess with the actual number and give feedback.
4. Output: Display whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low, and the number of attempts taken.
5. Repeat the process 3 times
